# Solar System Simulation using Three.js
This project is a 3D interactive simulation of the solar system developed as part of my Frontend Web Development assignment.

## Live Demo

## Project Overview
This simulation demonstrates the use of Three.js to create realistic 3D models of the sun and eight planets, showcasing their:
- Relative sizes and textures
- Independent orbital motions with adjustable speeds
- Self-rotation with axial tilt
- Orbit paths
- Realistic starfield background

Additionally, it includes interactive features such as:
- OrbitControls for rotating, zooming, and panning the view
- Static labels for planet identification
- dat.GUI controls to adjust individual and global speeds
- Pause and resume functionality
- Zoom in and zoom out controls
- 
## Technologies Used
- Three.js – 3D rendering
- dat.GUI– Interactive control panel
- CSS2DRenderer– Static labels for planets
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Deepikabisht5/solar-system-threejs.git
2.  Open the folder in VS Code or your preferred IDE.
3. Use the *Live Server* extension or directly open index.html in a browser.
