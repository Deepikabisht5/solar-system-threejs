# Solar System Simulation using Three.js
This project is a 3D interactive simulation of the solar system developed as part of my Frontend Web Development assignment.

## Live Demo

## Project Overview
This simulation demonstrates the use of Three.js to create realistic 3D models of the sun and eight planets, showcasing their:
- Relative sizes and textures
- Independent orbital motions with adjustable speeds
- Self-rotation with axial tilt
- Orbit paths
- Realistic starfield background

Additionally, it includes interactive features such as:
- OrbitControls for rotating, zooming, and panning the view
- Static labels for planet identification
- dat.GUI controls to adjust individual and global speeds
- Pause and resume functionality
- Zoom in and zoom out controls
- 
## Technologies Used
- Three.js – 3D rendering
- dat.GUI– Interactive control panel
- CSS2DRenderer– Static labels for planets
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to Run Locally
1. *Download or clone this repository folder* to your local machine.
2. Ensure the folder contains:
   - index.html
   - script.js
   - style.css (if used)
   - All *texture images* used for sun, planets, rings, and star background
   - README.md
3. *Open the folder* in VS Code or your preferred IDE to check file paths if needed.
4. *Run the project:*
   - Simply *double click index.html* to open in your default browser
   - Alternatively, right click index.html and choose *“Open with Live Server”* if using VS Code Live Server extension for smoother execution
5. The simulation should load displaying the *sun, planets, rings, and controls* as demonstrated in your submission
